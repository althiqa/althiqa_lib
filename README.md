# 🧪 What is althiqa?
**althiqa develops a SaaS reporting tool to enable business teams to regain control on artificial intelligence (AI) models with minimal effort.**

The tool brings together two types of users:

- 👩‍💻 Data scientists on the one hand, who can, via an intuitive API, systematize the evaluation phase of their AI models by generating fully customizable reports that allow them to communicate the key elements of their projects in an efficient and dynamic way. 

- 👩‍💼 Non-technical experts (e.g. business, compliance, risk teams) on the other hand can interact with a no code interface to gain visibility, understanding and trust in their AI models.

# When should you use althiqa?
### When data scientists want to report to non-techical stakeholders.

- Data scientists remain in total control of their metrics and can craft great stories consumable by business experts.
- Data scientists can iterate with the business experts on the most relevant choice of AI models.

### When business teams want to arbitrate tradeoffs between the different coarse-grained metrics of interest.

- Business experts can visualize information they care about (e.g. business KPIs, ESG metrics, fairness, robustness).
- Business experts can do hypothesis driven iterations.

### When business teams wants to monitor coarse-grained metrics on production models.

- Business managers and models' operators are empowered with holistic reporting on AI projects in real time.


# 📚 Resources

Different stakeholders care about different metrics. Here are some resources (interview studies and case studies) that we found particularly relevant to describe the critical problem of communication between stakeholders that althiqa is addressing.

<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09125.pdf">Operationalizing Machine Learning: An Interview Study.</a>"The need to evaluate product-critical metrics stemmed from close collaboration with other stakeholders, such as product managers and business operators. A key reason many ML projects fail is that they don’t measure metrics that will yield the organization value"

<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.09511.pdf">The Fallacy of AI Functionality.</a>"Throughout the chain of actors, potential miscommunications or outright lies can happen about the performance, functional safety or other aspects of deployed AI/ML systems. Communication failures often co-occur with other functional safety problems, and the lack of accountability".
